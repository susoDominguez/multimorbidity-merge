## Forked Use Case 

The following repository has been modified from its original source material, applied as an use case for the published paper

```
V. Zamborlini, R. Hoekstra, M. Silveira, C. Pruski, A. Teije, Generalizing the Detection of Internal and External Interactions in Clinical Guidelines, in: Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Health Informatics (HEALTHINF2016), Rome, Italy.

## Schema Folder

This folder contains the extended TMR schema to define subguidelines, that is, sets of recommendations from the same CIG which must be suggested as a whole for a particular clinical case.

## Instance Folder

This folder contains the three machine-interpretable clinical guidelines excerpts from the original use case -diabetes (DB), hypertension (HT) and osteoarthritis (OA)-, along with the combination of them three as generated by the CIG interaction service embedded with an extended version of TMR model and endpoints for dynamically merging (parts of) CIGs. Additionally, the folder also holds data sets for care actions, causation beliefs and transitions/situations/properties. All of them have been reintroduced using the CIG interaction service:

## cds_hooks folder
This folder contains a definition of the contextual information following CDS Hook specifications with respect to the 3 CIGs, DB, HT and OA. It also contains an instantiation of the hook-pattern as a JSON document. A CDS Card response to the instantiation example can also be found in the file `FHIR_response.json` also in this folder.
