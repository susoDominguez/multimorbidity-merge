## Forked Use Case 

The following repository has been modified from its original source material, applied as an use case for the published paper

```
V. Zamborlini, R. Hoekstra, M. Silveira, C. Pruski, A. Teije, Generalizing the Detection of Internal and External Interactions in Clinical Guidelines, in: Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Health Informatics (HEALTHINF2016), Rome, Italy.

```

## Schema Folder

This folder contains the extended TMR modelling schema. The extension allows to represent `subguidelines`, that is, sets of recommendations from the same computer-interpretable guideline that must be suggested together for a particular clinical case.

## Instance Folder

This folder contains the three machine-interpretable clinical guidelines excerpts taken from the original use case -diabetes (DB), hypertension (HT) and osteoarthritis (OA)- along with the merging of them three as generated by the CIG processing tool embedded with an extended version of TMR model found in:
```
https://github.kcl.ac.uk/k1214757/TMRWebX

```
Additionally, the folder also holds data sets for care actions, causation beliefs and transitions/situations/properties. All of them have also been reintroduced using the CIG processing tool.



## cds_hooks folder
This folder contains a definition of the contextual information following CDS Hook specifications with respect to the 3 CIGs, DB, HT and OA. It also contains an instantiation of the hook-pattern as a JSON document and a CDS Card response to the instantiation example (file `FHIR_response.json`) where all three CIGs have ben triggered, and thus combined, and converted into one CarePlan FHIR resource containing all recommendations from the three CIGs and the interactions identified among them.
